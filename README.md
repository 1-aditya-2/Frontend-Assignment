## Project Description:
   A React application that will allow users to paste a UI schema on the left side and preview the rendered form on the right-hand side. The application will have a     single screen which will be divided into two equal sections next to each other. On the left section will be a JSON editor to paste the UI-Schema. On the right        section, a form will be automatically rendered based on the pasted UI-Schema.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies 
```bash
  npm install
```
3. Start the development server
```bash
  npm run dev
```
This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### Building for production

To create a production build, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will build the app for production and output the files to the build folder. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes for efficient caching.
